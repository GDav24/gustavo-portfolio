Gustavo's Portfolio 

Description:
This project is a deployed URL that includes my (Gustavo's) portfolio with 3 important criteria: 
-About me:
Details specific details about my life and how I was introduced into coding and what my goals are for the bootcamp. 
-Work:
Includes pictures that are linked to URLs of applications made with the bootcamp. Like the Horiseon refractor challenge and the Run Buddy work from the modules. 
-Contact:
